# ML-ClusteringAndDimensionalityReduction

This repository contains coursework and implementations for the **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction** class, part of the **Honours Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence** degree at Durham College.

## 📘 Course Overview

The course explores unsupervised machine learning techniques, focusing on two major areas:
- **Clustering**: Partitioning data into meaningful groups without labeled responses.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while preserving the essence of the dataset.

## 🧪 Topics Covered

- **K-Means Clustering**
  - Elbow Method
  - Silhouette Score
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
  - Dendrograms
  - Agglomerative Methods
- **DBSCAN**
  - Density-based clustering
  - Noise and outlier detection
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
  - Variance explanation
  - 2D/3D projections
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
  - Non-linear dimensionality reduction
  - Data visualization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Libraries:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
